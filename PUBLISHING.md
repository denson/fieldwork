# Fieldwork publication

Public site: https://denson.github.io/fieldwork/

Public repository: https://github.com/denson/fieldwork

The repository's `portfolio/` directory is the GitHub Pages artifact. Root project research, meeting notes, bot setup logs, temporary scripts and downloaded template bundles are excluded from Git. Keep the explicit `.gitignore` allowlist when adding files. Website source and the extension remain in their original local directories.

Push reviewed changes to `main`. The Pages workflow runs all activity and extension tests before deployment. No local preview server or separate backend is needed for visitors.

The tutorial is the plain homepage. Use `?demo=home` for the portfolio, or `?demo=history`, `?demo=quakes`, `?demo=budget`, `?demo=hearing` for a subject. Keep `/fieldwork/` in all public links.

Public bot references and current instruction sources live in `portfolio/lessons/`. Publish changed bot instructions/greetings separately in BoodleBox. A website update does not automatically change a bot's attached reference snapshot or its instructions.

Companion Pane 0.6.0 supports this public address, the existing public Colorado Weed Field Guide and local development addresses. Reload an unpacked extension after its code changes, then refresh both normal pages. Ordinary site content and bot instruction changes do not require an extension reload.
